# DeFi Phishing Defense Toolkit

This tool focuses on detecting suspicious URLs, monitoring wallet addresses for suspicious activities, and integrating with a phishing database to provide real-time protection.

## Features

- **Suspicious URL Detection:** Analyze URLs and detect potential phishing sites by checking against a phishing database, domain registration information, and known phishing patterns.
- **Wallet Address Monitoring:** Monitor Ethereum wallet addresses for any suspicious activity and alert the user if any suspicious transactions are detected.
- **Phishing Database Integration:** Integrate with a database of known phishing URLs to provide real-time detection and protection.

   url_to_check = "https://example-phishing-site.com"
   if url_checker.is_suspicious_url(url_to_check):
       print(f"Suspicious URL detected: {url_to_check}")
   else:
       print(f"URL is safe: {url_to_check}")
   \```

2. **Wallet Address Monitoring:**
   Monitor a wallet address for suspicious transactions.
   \```python
   node_url = "https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID"
   wallet_monitor = WalletMonitor(node_url, phishing_db)
   wallet_address = "0xYourWalletAddressHere"
   wallet_monitor.monitor_address(wallet_address)
   \```
